# K-means Clustering

K-means clustering is an iterative unsupervised machine learning algorithm that aims to partition a given dataset into K distinct clusters. Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean value, also known as the centroid. K-means clustering is widely used for data analysis, pattern recognition, and image compression.

## Algorithm Overview

The K-means algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Select K initial cluster centroids either randomly or based on some predefined criterion.

2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid by calculating the Euclidean distance or other distance measures.

3. **Update**: Recalculate the centroids by computing the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.

4. **Repeat**: Iterate steps 2 and 3 until convergence, where either the centroids no longer change significantly or a predefined number of iterations is reached.

5. **Termination**: The algorithm converges when the centroids stabilize, and the final clustering result is obtained.

## Visualization of K-means Clustering

To illustrate the K-means algorithm, consider the following example with a two-dimensional dataset.

1. **Step 1: Initialization**: Initially, K centroids are randomly placed in the data space.

2. **Step 2: Assignment**: Each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid. In the visualization, different colors represent different clusters.

3. **Step 3: Update**: The centroids are updated by calculating the mean of the data points in each cluster. The centroids move towards the center of their respective clusters.

4. **Step 4: Repeat**: Steps 2 and 3 are iteratively performed until convergence. In each iteration, data points are reassigned to the nearest centroids, and the centroids are updated.

5. **Step 5: Termination**: The algorithm converges when the centroids stabilize, resulting in the final clustering of the data.

The visualization helps to understand the progression of the K-means algorithm as it iteratively refines the clustering solution. The final result reveals distinct clusters that capture the structure of the data.
